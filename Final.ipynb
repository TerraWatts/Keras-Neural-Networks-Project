    "\n",
    "This is the final project for the course titled \"Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras,\" a part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera. This project uses neural networks to study a concrete dataset. The dataset contains information on the quantities of materials used in a given batch of concrete, the age of the concrete, and the measured strength of the concrete. The goal of this exercise is to train neural networks to predict the strength of a batch given its other characteristics."
